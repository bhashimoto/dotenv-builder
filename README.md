# dotenv-builder
CLI tool to help build template .env file based on existing .env file

## Why?
Copying .env data sucks. With this, you can pass a blank template based on your .env file and use it in your target environment

## Setup
Build the executable:
```bash
go build
```
(optional) Add an alias to your .bashrc:
```bash
alias dotenv=[path-to-your-executable]
```

## Usage
 * Go to the directory with the .env file to copy.
 * Run the script
 * ???
 * Profit
